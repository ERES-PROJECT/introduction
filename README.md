# Equitable Resilient Energy Systems (ERES)

**Equitable Resilient Energy Systems (ERES)** is a research project dedicated to:

1. **Analyzing consumer energy rate data** with econometric and machine learning techniques to determine the effects of deregulating energy markets.  
2. **Providing a platform for consumers** to find their best energy rates.  

Utilizing **Python** and **SQL** for cross-source data scraping, aggregation, processing, and analysis, we examine **Pennsylvania’s historical and current retail rates** alongside **wholesale rates**.  
We then analyze trends between retail rate prices and **geographic** and **socio-economic data** to determine **energy price fairness** and detect **anomalies** for residential consumers.

Using our analysis, we build **reports for policymakers** to promote **energy and economic fairness**, and host an **application for consumers** to find the plan that works best for them.
